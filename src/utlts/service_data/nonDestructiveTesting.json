    "points": [
      "Principles of Eddy Current Testing (ET)\n        The fundamental principle of Eddy Current Testing involves the generation of alternating current in a probe coil when it is brought close to a conductive material. This alternating current creates changing magnetic fields that induce eddy currents in the conductive material. The presence of defects, variations in material thickness, or changes in electrical conductivity causes disruptions in the eddy currents. These disruptions are detected by the probe coil, and the resulting signals are analysed to identify defects or evaluate material properties.\n        ",

It relies on the principle that magnetic field distortion occurs around a defect, and this distortion can be visualized using magnetic particles. ",
    "points": [
      "The core fundamental principle of Magnetic Particle /MT Testing is based on the interaction between magnetic fields and material defects. When a magnetic field is applied to a ferromagnetic material, such as iron, steel, or nickel, the magnetic field lines pass through the material, creating an invisible magnetic flux. If there is a defect, such as a crack, porosity, or inclusion, present on or near the surface, the magnetic field lines become distorted, causing a leakage of the magnetic flux.",
      "During the inspection, a magnetic field is induced into the test object either through direct magnetization (using a magnetic yoke or electromagnetic coil) or through indirect magnetization (using a magnetic bench or prod). Next, magnetic particles are applied to the surface of the test object in the form of dry particles or as a wet suspension (magnetic ink). These particles are specifically designed to be attracted to areas of magnetic flux leakage, making defects visible",
      "If there is a surface or near-surface defect present, the magnetic particles will accumulate at the defect site, forming a visible indication. The indications take the form of well-defined lines or clusters, outlining the shape and extent of the defect. Inspectors can then examine these indications to assess the type, size, and location of the detected defects.",
